# tic_tac_toe_game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using Python and Tkinter GUI. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces on a 3x3 board with their chosen symbol, X or O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
